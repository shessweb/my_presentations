  Title:      Using Deep-Learning to Map the Solar Far-Side Magnetic Flux from Helioseismic Measurements
  Authors:    Hess Webber, Shea A; Chen, Ruizhu; Zhao, Junwei
  Abstract:   The solar far-side magnetic flux is a crucial physical quantity for space weather forecasting and solar wind
  modeling, but it is not currently directly observed. For about 4 years, the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) 304 Angstrom flux of 
  the far side was observed by STEREO/EUVI, which is used to produce proxy far-side magnetic flux maps (talk by R. Chen, Monday).
  Helioseismic far-side imaging methods are also used to produce far-side acoustic maps from near-side observations, which 
  indirectly detect large active regions on the far side; however, these acoustic maps are not calibrated to magnetic flux. In 
  this work, we use a deep-learning approach to produce far-side magnetic flux maps in near-real-time using near-side observations
  alone. Our neural network is trained on âˆ¼2500 pairs (3.5 years, two pairs of maps per day) of far-side acoustic maps and 
  magnetic flux proxy maps, and then test on the remaining half year of data. The final product can then be further calibrated to
  magnetic flux-transport maps for additional validation. This neural network will be applied to future far-side acoustic maps to
  produce near-real-time far-side magnetic flux maps, without the need for direct far-side observations.
